# Lean In
A place where we can submit markdown documents, wiki articles, manage issues/feedback, and organize projects around a body of work dedicated to understanding `Minimalism`, through `Lean`, `applied`.

Use `Projects` and `Tags` to create and manage `Lean In Circles`, small groups who meet regularly to learn and grow together, stepping outside comfort zones and **`leaning in`**.

### The Art of [`GyShiDo`](https://gyshido.com)

| Relentless Focus  | Single Task  | Boring Consistency  | No Bullshit  | No Meetings  | Follow Up  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Focus on the 10% of your activities which drive most of the value. Relentlessly. | Multitasking is a myth. By doing multiple things at the same time we keep ourselves busy doing shitty work with lousy outcomes. Laser sharp focus. | Do the right things over and over again. Consistency forms habits. Habits make hard things effortless. | Don’t bullshit yourself or others. Apply brutal honesty and transparency to everything you do. | Meetings come in only two forms: Standing or social. If it’s social, it’s over breakfast, lunch, coffee, dinner or drinks. If not – don’t sit down. | Don’t let others wait for your part of the job. Ever. |
